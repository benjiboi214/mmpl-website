      Melbourne Metropolitan Pool League Inc. (MMPL) is a non-profit 
      organisation established to promote and co-ordinate the sport 
      of 8-Ball in the inner district of Melbourne. The MMPL conducts 
      two seasons of competition annually, the more highly-regarded 
      one in winter (April to September – usually about 18 rounds) 
      and the less-serious one in summer (November to March – usually 
      about 9 rounds), in which up to 20 separate venues participate 
      in the Melbourne CBD and surrounding areas.
